## Projects

**Enhancing Game Level Generation via RLCF-guided MarioGPT @ Postgraduate Dissertation (_May 2024 - September 2024_)**
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pytorch, Transformer
	As part of my master's research, I have researched enhancing the game-level generation capabilities of MarioGPT, a state-of-the-art PCG system for Super Mario games. While MarioGPT can generate ready-to-play game levels directly from text prompts, challenges remain in improving the playability and novelty of the level designs. My research objective is to study the impact of reinforcement learning on MarioGPT. I leveraged reinforcement learning to fine-tune the model to align level generation with enhanced playability and novelty based on feedback from the computer-based evaluator function.

**Cloud Based Application for Map Overlaying and Data Analysis of Geographical Information @ Undergraduate Academic Project (_August 2013 - February 2014_)**
- **Technologies Used**: Java, Servlet, HTML, Amazon Web Services (DynamoDB, Kinesis), Google map API
	Developed a cloud based application for storing, data analyzing and creating a customized map with the help of geographical information. Query the geographical data stored in the database with specific constraints to analyze the data and overlay the GPS coordinates on the Google map to provide a map to the user for the respective coordinates. The input for the application is in the form of the GPS coordinates (Longitude and Latitude) with specific information and is stored in the Amazon DynamoDB. DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service. Amazon Kinesis is a fully managed service for real-time processing of streaming data at massive scale. Kinesis stream is used for replicating the data in the two or more AWS regional server for enhance the availability of data. An android application is also developed to store the GPS coordinate in DynamoDB during the surveying process.
